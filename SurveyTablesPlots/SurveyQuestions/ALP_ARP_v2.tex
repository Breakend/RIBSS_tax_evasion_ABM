11&  perceivedpenaltyrate  &\parbox[c][0.15\textheight][c]{0.68\textwidth} {   Now let's consider the penalty rate. If the IRS detects that a person has underreported their taxes, they will first have to pay the unpaid taxes that were due. In addition, they will be assessed a penalty that is a percentage of the amount they underpaid. This percentage is the penalty rate. Imagine a person was caught underpaying their taxes by \$1000. In addition to having to pay that \$1000, how much of a penalty would they have to pay?\\
{\bf NOTE:} We converted this response to a peproportion so that in our analysis perceivedpenaltyrate  represents a proportion relative to \$1000.
